Using context.Context with cobra
================================

This is a demonstration of how to integrate a `context.Context` with
cobra commands.

Once you have built the program, you can try:

    $ ./cobra-context-demo cmd1
    $ ./cobra-context-demo cmd2

and press `ctrl-C` in both cases to see what happens.

The [accompanying blog
post](https://blog.ksub.org/bytes/2019/10/07/using-context.context-with-cobra/)
explains the motivation and implementation.
